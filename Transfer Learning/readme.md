1. Data preparation
2. Models training
- Option 1 (model not learned and change only last layer)
- Option 2 (model not learned and change all classifier)
3. Models training with Transfer Learning
- Option 1 (model pre-trained, no frozen pre-trained parameters, change last layer)
- Option 2 (model pre-trained, no frozen pre-trained parameters, change all classifier)
- Option 3 (model pre-trained, frozen pre-trained parameters, change all classifier)
- Finetuning
